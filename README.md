# Predicting-Term-Deposit-Subscriptions-EDA-and-Missing-Data-Imputation
This project explores a binary classification task using the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. As part of IST 707 coursework, the project focuses on data preprocessing and imputation techniques to handle missing values in key features such as age, contact, and day. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the dataset's structure, distributions, and categorical trends were assessed to inform the cleaning process. Visualizations and statistical summaries highlight patterns in customer behavior, laying the groundwork for machine learning model development in later stages. This notebook emphasizes the importance of thoughtful data preparation in predictive modeling pipelines.
